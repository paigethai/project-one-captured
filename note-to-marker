Hello! 

Unfortunately, I was unable to finish this project. 

I had struggled a lot with sass and some major CSS styling components. I was able to get some 1:1 mentoring, but it still was taking me a long time to get things to where I wanted them to. 

I would like for an opportunity to finish the Blog and Contact pages so that I can complete the project to add to my portfolio. 

I'd also would like to finish adding in the media querires to make the site responsive.
